# Apps-Monopoly


The app is for assisting the activity in physics department at National Taiwan University (NTU). 

Specifically, the physics department of NTU held the orientation camp (迎新宿營), which is an orientation for incoming physics undergratuate students. One of the activity in the camp is "monopoly", the "reality" version of monopoly, which is an well-known board game. The reality version is in the sense that each player must literality walk from one slot to another slot and interact with the real persons, such as winning a small game over the game master and another team. The scale of the game involves ~40 slots, ~10 players (each player is a team, invovling ~ 10 people), and dimension size in the the real site is roughly the same as a playgournd in a school. The number of people involving in this activity is 150+. To help the game proceed, my classmates are I developped this app to assist it. It supports mulitple functions including recording assets (so that we don't need to make real paper money for the game), stock manipulation, attacking between teams. On the other hand, since the game requires interative manipulation, we also use another servers to simultaneously netwrok with each other for keeping all information updated.


The project is collaborated with Che Chiang and Jun-Ting Guo.

1. Description: To help engaging one of the activity (Monopoly) in orientation camp in NTU
physics.
2. Contribution: I organize the whole structure of the app, including how to incorporate the app
into the game, and the main structure of the game. I am also responsible for all client-end design
and partly involve server-end work.
