# Apps-Monopoly


The app is for assisting the activity in physics department at National Taiwan University (NTU). 

Specifically, the physics department of NTU held the orientation camp (迎新宿營), which is the an orientation for incoming physics undergratuate students. One of the activity in the camp is "monopoly", the "reality" version of monopoly, the famous board game. The reality version is in the sense that each player must walk from one slot to another slot and interact with the real persons, such as winning a small game over the game master and another team. The scale of the game involves ~40 slots, ~10 players (each player is a team, invovling ~ 10 people), and dimension size in the the real site is roughly the same as a playgournd in a school. The number of people involving in this activity is 150+. To help the game proceed, my classmates are I developped this App to assist it, and it supports the function including recording assets (so that we don't need to make real paper money for the game), stock manipulation, attacking between teams.


The project is collaborated with Che Chiang and Jun-Ting Guo.
